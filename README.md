# Sudoku Solver Using Simulated Annealing
![](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ifgung48dlcrw61/sudoku-solver-using-simulated-annealing-cover.png?raw=1)  
This web app uses Simulated Annealing to solve Sudoku puzzles. Sudoku is a number puzzle where a 9x9 grid must be filled with digits 1 to 9, ensuring each row, column, and 3x3 sub-grid has all digits once.  

Simulated Annealing is an optimization algorithm that mimics the process of annealing in metallurgy. It explores different solutions, including worse ones, gradually reducing the acceptance of worse solutions over time. This helps it find the best solution to a problem, even in complex scenarios.

## Key Features 

 1. Solve Sudoku puzzles of different difficulty levels: Easy, Medium, and Hard.
 2. Generate random Sudoku puzzles for solving with different difficulty levels: Easy, Medium, and Hard.
 3. Use the Simulated Annealing algorithm to solve Sudoku puzzles.
 4. Highlight errors and conflicts in the input Sudoku grid for easy identification.
 5. Customize simulated annealing parameters for fine-tuning the solving process.

## About
As a computer science student in my third year, second semester, I have been assigned the task of implementing a local search algorithm for solving Sudoku puzzles as part of my artificial intelligence subject. This assignment has sparked my interest, leading me to incorporate it into a web application.
